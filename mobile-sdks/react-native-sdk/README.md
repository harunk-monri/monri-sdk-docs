# ðŸŸ£ ReactNative SDK

The Monri React-Native SDK makes it easy to build an excellent payment experience in your Android/iOS app. It provides powerful, customizable, UI elements to use out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details.

## Payment API Integration

At some point in the flow of your app you'll obtain payment details from the user. After that you could:

* use obtained payment details and proceed with charge (confirmPayment)
* or tokenize obtained payment details for server side usage

In [Payment API Integration](payment-api-integration.md) it's explained how to:

* create payment
* collect payment details
* confirm payment
* get results back on your app and on your backend

If you want to tokenize obtained payment details then continue to the "Tokens API Integration"

## Tokens API Integration

After you've obtained payment details its easy to securely transfer collected data via Tokens API.

In [Tokens API Integration](tokens-api-integration.md) it's explained how to:

* create token request
* create token
* how to use created token for transaction authorization on your backend

## Installation Guide

```shell
npm install react-native-monri-android-ios
```

### Usage

```javascript
import MonriAndroidIos from "react-native-monri-android-ios";

// ...

const result = await MonriAndroidIos.confirmPayment({
